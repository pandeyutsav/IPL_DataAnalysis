# IPL_DataAnalysis
An end-to-end data engineering project analyzing IPL match insights using Spark, AWS, and Python visualizations.

:

🏏 IPL Data Engineering & Analytics Project
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data engineering and analytics pipeline built using Apache Spark, AWS S3, Spark SQL, and Python to extract, transform, and analyze IPL match data. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from raw cricket data and showcase data engineering skills through advanced analytics and visualizations.

🔧 Tech Stack
Apache Spark: Distributed data processing and transformation

AWS S3: Cloud storage for IPL datasets

Spark SQL: Structured queries for analytical aggregations

Python (Matplotlib, Pandas): Data visualization and preprocessing

📊 Key Features
🚀 Built a robust ETL pipeline using Spark to ingest and preprocess match and delivery data from AWS S3

🧹 Cleaned and enriched data schemas by removing irrelevant records (wides/no-balls), standardizing player data, and adding calculated fields

📈 Performed advanced analytics using Spark SQL:

Boundary Analysis: Examined the role of boundaries in match outcomes

Dismissal Distribution: Visualized various types of player dismissals

Top Performers: Identified highest individual scores in IPL history

📉 Created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib for data storytelling

🎯 Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience in real-world data engineering practices

Applied scalable big data tools to solve analytical problems

Developed visual storytelling techniques to communicate complex patterns
